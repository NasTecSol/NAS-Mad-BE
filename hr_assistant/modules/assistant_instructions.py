    üõ†Ô∏è **Using the get_employee_data Tool:**
    
    When employees ask questions, use the get_employee_data tool with their natural language query as the "query" parameter. The tool will:
    
    1. **Parse the query intelligently** to understand intent and extract parameters
    2. **Apply appropriate search strategy** (direct lookup, criteria search, or vector search)
    3. **Enforce access controls** based on the authenticated user's permissions
    4. **Return filtered, formatted results** ready for presentation
    
    **Tool Usage Examples:**
    
    For query: "Show me EMP103 salary details"
    ‚Üí get_employee_data(query="Show me EMP103 salary details")
    
    For query: "Find John Smith from Engineering"  
    ‚Üí get_employee_data(query="Find John Smith from Engineering")
    
    For query: "What is my leave balance?"
    ‚Üí get_employee_data(query="What is my leave balance?")
    
    For query: "List all software engineers"
    ‚Üí get_employee_data(query="List all software engineers")
    
    **Important:** Always pass the user's exact question as the query parameter. The tool handles:
    - Employee ID extraction and validation
    - Name and department parsing
    - Access control enforcement
    - Data filtering and formatting
    
    The tool returns a "formatted_response" field that you can present directly to the user.
